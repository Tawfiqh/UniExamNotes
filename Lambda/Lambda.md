Rules of ŒªŒ≤
-------------------------------------------------------------------
s=t  
\-\-\-\-\- Symmetry  
t=s



s = t     t = u  
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Transitivity
s = u

etc, etc...


So ŒªŒ≤|- s=t  is not defined as =Œ≤ but they are provably equivalent.  

ŒªŒ≤|- s=t is defined as:  
Symmetry, transitivity, reflexivity  
Application, abstraction, Œ≤-reduction.  

and

=Œ≤ is the reflexive, symmetric, transitive closure of ‚ÜíŒ≤

Exercise: show =Œ≤ implements ŒªŒ≤  

First recursion theorem:  
‚àÄf‚ààŒõ ‚àÉu‚ààŒõ st fu = u

Second recursion theorem:  
‚àÄf ‚àÉu st f[[u]]=u





<a id="Œ≤equality"></a>
* * *
Œ≤ Equality, reflexive transitive closure of ‚ÜíŒ≤
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Diagram of the two way equality.

![s =Œ≤ t](sequalst.jpg)

Just prove it using the diagram and make use of Church-Rosser.

The precise thing would be:
At each level we reduce to one less term.
So after n-1 levels we have only 1 term.




<a id="head"></a>
* * *
Head Reduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This is HNF:  
s ‚â° Œªx1...xn . y s1...sm

###Head Reduction:  
Œªx0...xn . (Œªy.u)t s0‚Ä¢...‚Ä¢sm ‚Üíh Œªx0...xn . u[t/y]‚Ä¢s0‚Ä¢...‚Ä¢sm

An application can

A headmost reduction is always a **LEFTMOST reduction**. And it's *bloody*
obvious what a leftmost reduction is.

Solvable *IFF* HNF


###Internal reduction
A Œ≤ reduction that isn't a head reduction.


###Other Reductions.

Leftmost - Not even going to define this. DBI.  
Standard - Once something is reduced, nothing to the left of that is reduced.  
(Standard is a property of a whole reduction).  

A standard deduction has to precede from the left, but not necessarily left**most**!

Head and leftmost reductions are standard. #standard.

###Some results

1. Every standard reduction sequence ending in a normal form is leftmost.
2. If s has a Œ≤ normal form. Then standard reduction is sufficient (specifically **leftmost** is sufficient) to obtain it.



<a id="consistency"></a>
* * *
Consistency
----------------------------------------------------------------
To show it isn't consistent show that it equates all terms.

So for all s, t. They can be equated.




<a id="genericity"></a>
* * *
Genericity Lemma
-------------------------------------------------------------------

FOR ALL/ANY CONTEXTS C

If s is unsolvable

and **C[s] = t**  for some solvable t  
then for all x: **C[x] = t**

So if a context can take an unsolvable term and return a solvable term.
It must just ignore its input.

Sometimes we use two contexts to show that one thing holds for **C**
and then something holds for **C'** and for some input **C** = **C'**.




<a id="combinators"></a>
* * *
Combinators
-------------------------------------------------------------------
**œâ**=Œªx.xx  
**Œ©**=**œâœâ**  

**t**=Œªxy.x  
**f**=Œªxy.y  


**k infinity**=**YK**

**k**=Œªxy.x  
**s**=Œªxyz.xz(yz)

**i** = Well this one is obvious...

**Œ∏** = (Œªxy.y(xxy)) (Œªxy.y(xxy))  ‚â° **Y S i**  
**Y** = Œªf.(Œªx.f(xx))

<a id="Ycombinator"></a>
* * *
The Y combinator
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Yf = f(Yf)

<!-- Y = Œªf.(Œªx.f(xx))(Œªx.f(xx)) -->


Q:Find some term **s** st: s = Œªx.xss
Abstract out s: Œªsx.xss and then apply the Y combinator.

s ‚â° Y(Œªsx.xss)

then s ‚â° Y(Œªsx.xss) = (Œªsx.xss)(Y(Œªsx.xss)) = Œªx.xss üòÑ




<a id="ChurchNumerals"></a>
* * *
Church Numerals
-------------------------------------------------------------------


[n] = Œªfx. fff...fffx    \{naturally n lots of f's\}  
[0] = Œªfx.x    (=**f**)  
[1] = Œªfx.fx  


Lists - xxyz


Godel Numbering - We basically have an enumeration of the terms.
So for each integer we have an associated term.
And for each term we have an associated integer.


<a id="ScottCurry"></a>
* * *
Scott's Curry Theorem
-------------------------------------------------------------------

###The Curry
Œ¶ ‚ää A,B ‚ää Œõ and A, B closed under Œ≤-Convertability:

There does not exist a term f st for all terms x

fx = **t** iff x in A
fx = **f** iff x in B

###The Lemma
For some set X.  
Œ¶ ‚ää X ‚ää Œõ and X closed under Œ≤-Convertability ====> X is not recursive.  



<a id="functions"></a>
* * *
Functions - Recursive or otherwise
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Partial function <====> Strongly Œª-definable.






<a id="CLs"></a>
* * *
Combinatory Logic
-------------------------------------------------------------------


Made of four components:

+ Variables: x ‚àà V then x ‚àà Tcl
+ **K**
+ **S**
+ Composition: A,B ‚àà Tcl then AB ‚àà Tcl


3 rules:

+ Application A=A' B=B' then AB=A'B'
+ **K** A B = B
+ **S** A B C = A C (B C)

**I** = **SKK**

###Fake Lambda

+ ŒªŒªx.x = **SKK**  
+ ŒªŒªx.A = **K** A  Where x not in A  
+ ŒªŒªx.BC = **S**(ŒªŒªx.B)(ŒªŒªx.C)  Where in B or C.  


Combinatory Algebras
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Term Algebra is a quadruple - < A, . , **K**, **S** \>

An environment (valuation) is just a map P: V ---> A
Maps variables to terms of our algebra.

###Œª-Algebra
An algebra in which ŒªŒ≤ |- t=u ===> ‚àÄp [[t]]p = [[u]]p  


(Not godel numbering, this is the actual syntax, it's for evaluation under a map).




<a id="types"></a>
* * *
Types
-------------------------------------------------------------------
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Variables  
\{x:A\} |--> x:A  



Œì ‚û°Ô∏è s: A‚ñ∂Ô∏èB, Œì' ‚û°Ô∏è  t: A  
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Application  
Œì U Œì' ‚û°Ô∏è st:B

Œì‚û°Ô∏ès:B  
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Abstraction \{Œì consistent with \{x:A\} \}  
Œì ‚û°Ô∏è Œªx.s : A ‚ñ∂Ô∏è B


We say two types are consistent if they don't contradict on the type of any variable.

Subject Construction Lemma: Construction tree and deduction trees are like the same but upside down lol. ‚ÜïÔ∏è



Deductions are unique when the term is in Œ≤-Normal form.

Subject Reduction Theorem - S:A and S reduces to t then t:A  
Œì |- s : A and s ‚ÜíŒ≤ t  =======>  Œì |- t : A



Typable terms are closed under:

1. Subterms
2. Œ≤-Reduction
3. Abstraction


<a id="typability"></a>
* * *
Typability
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Typability ‚Üí Strongly Normalising

However Œªx.xx *is* strongly normalising, but **NOT** typable.

Terms that are untypable:

+ xx
+ Œªx.xx   (=œâ)
+ Œ© = (Œªx.xx) (Œªx.xx)
+ Y = Œªf. (Œªx.f(xx)) (Œªx.f(xx))


Principal Deduction - A deduction of **s : A** such that all other
deductions of **s : A** are instances of this deduction.


Principal type Algorithm  
Returns either that the term is untypable, or it returns the principal type.


<a id="Robinsons"></a>
* * *
Robinson's Unification Algorithm  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Determines whether two types are unifiable and if so it returns the most general unifier.

	Input(A, B):
		i=0
		U0 = E 	//The empty/identity unification.
		while(true)
			if (Ui(A) = Ui(B)) return U = Ui

			else //Ui(A) and Ui(B) differ somewhere.
				//Ui(A) = String1 c stringa
				//Ui(B) = String1 D stringb

				if(c in Vars(D)) return untypable
				else Ui+i = [D/c] . Ui
			i++


<a id="TypeAlgorithm"></a>
* * *
Principal type algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Input s a term. Output S's principal type OR s is untypable.




<a id="undecidability"></a>
* * *
Undecidability Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Equality in ŒªŒ≤ is undecidable.

2. However equality of **typable** terms is decidable because they are strongly
normalising.

3. Undecidable if a term has a normal form. (Page 109/203 lecture slides.)

4. Undecidable if a term is solvable.

5. Undecidable if a term is equal to some numeral.
