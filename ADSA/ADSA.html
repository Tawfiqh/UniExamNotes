<h2>Matchings</h2>

<p>Gale Shapley Marriage algorithm. I think you know this one 😉  </p>

<p>Valid Partner - A potential partner in <strong>some</strong> stable matching.</p>

<p><a id="Flows"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Flows 1</h2>

<p>Cut = Partition of vertices into A and B with s in A, t in B. <br />
Capacity of a cut (A,B): Sum of capacities e from A <strong>to</strong> B.</p>

<p>Value of a flow = Sum of flow on all edges leaving s.</p>

<p>Residual graph: <br />
Edge, e, in Gf is st: <br />
    f'(e) = c(e) - f(e)  for e in E <br />
    f'(e) = f(e)         for e not in E</p>

<p>Augmenting Path - Simple path s-->t <strong>in</strong> the residual graph. <br />
Bottleneck Capacity - Min capacity on an augmenting path.</p>

<h3>Ford Fulkerson.</h3>

<pre><code>Initialise flow to zero.  
While(an existing path in Gf){  
  Find augmenting path P.  
  Increase flow along P by bottleneck capacity.  
  Update residual graph.  
Return f.
</code></pre>

<p>Running time: O(V+2E) = O(E) according to one source.</p>

<h3>Flow &amp; Cut Theorems</h3>

<p>Flow value lemma: Net flow across a cut (Net from A to B) equals value of the whole flow. (This includes back flow from B into A)</p>

<p>Therefore: value(f) = Net flow out of A &lt;= Cap(A,B)</p>

<p>Max-flow = Min-cut <br />
(The problems are dual and their optimal solutions intersect).  </p>

<h3>Capacity-Scaling</h3>

<p>We define the X-Residual-graph as the residual graph but only with edge capacities larger than X.</p>

<pre><code>X = largest power of 2 &lt;= Max Capacity
While(X &gt;= 1)
    Update X-Residual-graph.
    While (Exists augPath P in X-Residual-graph)
        Augment flow on P.
        Update X-Residual-graph
    X = X/2
Return f
</code></pre>

<h3>Bipartite graphs</h3>

<p>A matching X ⊆ E(G) is a set st each node of the graph appears in at most one edge of X. <br />
We naturally want to find the maximal matching.</p>

<p>Bipartite Max matching: network flow formulation, unary edges. Max flow. <br />
O(mn)</p>

<p><strong>Perfect</strong> matching is when each node appears in <strong>EXACTLY</strong> one edge of the matching.</p>

<p>Hall's Theorem: G has a perfect matching <em>iff</em> Number of nodes adjacent to S = |S| for all subsets S of <strong>L</strong></p>

<p><strong>K-regular bipartite graph</strong> - Has a perfect matching. <br />
|R| = |L| = n <br />
Each node is connected to <strong>k</strong> other nodes.  </p>

<p>Max-Flow of value n:
f(s,x) = 1 <br />
f(x,t) = 1 <br />
f(u,v) = 1/k  </p>

<h3>Disjoint paths</h3>

<p>Edge distjoint</p>

<p>Max number of edge disjoint s->t paths = max flow.</p>

<p><strong>Disconnects</strong> -  A set X is a disconnect if all s->t paths need to use an
edge in X.</p>

<p>Mengers theorem. zzzz</p>

<p><strong>Max</strong> number of edge disjoint paths in undirected graps: <br />
Replace each edge with two antiparallell edges; Run Max flow.</p>

<h3>Circulation with demands.</h3>

<p>Max-flow formulation. <br />
Add a node s that feeds all the nodes with negative demands(supply). <br />
Add a node t that is fed by all the nodes with positive demands.</p>

<p><strong>Integer theorem</strong> If all capacaites and demands are integers ==> An integer
valued max-flow exists.</p>

<p>Circulation with lower bounds: model lower bounds as demands.</p>

<p><strong>Survey Design</strong> - Bipartite graph - max flow formulation.</p>

<p><a id="LPs"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Linear Programming</h2>

<p>Standard min form (primal):</p>

<p>Min:  cTx <br />
Ax >= b <br />
x >= 0  </p>

<p>Min Slack form (Slack form requires equality of the constraint):  </p>

<p>Min cTx <br />
Ax = b <br />
x >= 0</p>

<p><strong>Can convert</strong> from standard to slack form with tricks of inequalities. E.g: <br />
a=b ==> a&lt;=b &amp;&amp; b&lt;=a</p>

<p>Dual (Min): <br />
Max bTy <br />
ATy &lt;= c <br />
y >= 0</p>

<p>Weak Duality: x is feasible for primal, y is feasible for dual ==> cTx >= bTy</p>

<p>Duality (Strong): If the primal or the dual has a feasible and bounded solution, so does the other. And their optimal solution intersects.</p>

<h3>Shortest path LP</h3>

<p>Minimise: <br />
  ⎲  w(e) * x(e) <br />
  ⎳ <br />
edges</p>

<p>St. <br />
sum of edges leaving a node - sum of edges into a node = <br />
1 for s
-1 for t
0 for all other nodes</p>

<h3>Extreme Point Solutions</h3>

<p>Sometimes called vertices.</p>

<p>A solution is an extreme point solution if it is NOT a convex solution of two other solutions.</p>

<p>A convex solution (not extreme): x = <strong>t</strong> y - (1 - t) z</p>

<h3>Simplex</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start with a node in the polytope that is known to be feasible.</li>
<li>Move from the node to a neighbouring feasible node.</li>
<li>Stop at a local optimum.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note:Due to convexity a local optimum is also a global optimum.</p>

<h3>Ellipsoid</h3>

<p>Slow and numerically unstable in practice...</p>

<h3>Interior Point Methods</h3>

<ol>
<li>Start inside the polytope</li>
<li>Move around inside the polytope</li>
<li>Find the optimum.</li>
</ol>

<p><a id="approx"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Approximation Algorithms</h2>

<h3>A fistful of definitions</h3>

<p>Approximation ratio p - A solution to x will be within factor p away from the
optimal solution for x.</p>

<p>For Minimisation problems:</p>

<p>p = supremum A(X) / OPT(x)</p>

<p>(supremum is least upper bound)</p>

<p>For Maximisation problems:  Opt(X) / A(x)</p>

<p>so minimum p is always 1. 👌</p>

<h3>PTAS</h3>

<p>Arbitrary approximation ratio. <br />
Takes ε as an input. <br />
Returns a solution of size: 1 + ε <br />
Takes time polynomial in input size to problem. (May even be exponential in size 1/ε). <br />
E.g: O(n^ 1/ε)  </p>

<h3>FPTAS</h3>

<p>Polynomial in size of input (n) <strong>AND</strong> in 1/ε.</p>

<h3>Vertex Cover - NP Complete</h3>

<p>A vertex cover is a set of vertices. Such that every edge touches at least one of the vertices in C.</p>

<p>Approx Ratio 2.
Select an EDGE, add it's endpoints to the Cover, remove it's endpoints and all adjacent edges.</p>

<p>Can also use a LP based formulation and rounding of the relaxation. <br />
This is extensible to use with costs.</p>

<h3>Set cover problem</h3>

<p>Set F of subsets Si ⊆ U.</p>

<p><code>
Q = Φ <br />
Select Si ∈ F with Largest cardinality <br />
Q = Q U Si <br />
F = F \ Si <br />
Remove all elements of Si from F
</code></p>

<p>Approximation ratio = Ln(|U|)</p>

<p>Counterexample of size 2^n elements:  </p>

<p>Two rows of n elements <br />
Subset1 = first row <br />
Subset2 = second row <br />
and then a subset that takes 2^i-1 elements from each row.</p>

<p>(i.e each set is of size power of 2, but half it's elems are from the top row, half from the bottom 😉 &amp; then two sets that partition it in two.)</p>

<p>This is a counterexample because you should pick the two rows and then you cover the set with only two subsets. However the algorithm could equally pick the subset of size 2^n-1 that is the same size as a row but in this case spans both rows 😟</p>

<p><strong>Pseudo-Tree:</strong> Like a tree but with one additional edge ≡ At most |V| edges.</p>

<p><strong>Pseudo-forest:</strong>  a graph is a pseudo-forest if it is composed of connected components that are each pseudo-trees.</p>

<h3>Max 3-SAT.</h3>

<p>Trivial-Random algorithm has approx-ratio = <strong>8/7</strong> <br />
Algorithm <code>Select a random truth assignment</code> <br />
Is a 1/7 approximation algorithm. <br />
Expected number of clauses is n*(7/8), where n is the number of clauses.</p>

<h3>Derandomisation</h3>

<p>Uses the <em>linearity of expectation</em>.</p>

<p>X = (x1 + x2), (x2+ ¬x4), (x2+ x5), (¬x2+ x4), (x3+ ¬x5)</p>

<p>N(X) = N(x1 + x2) + N(x2+ ¬x4) + N(x2+ x5) + N(¬x2+ x4) + N(x3+ ¬x5)</p>

<p>Compare N(X(x1,x2,x3,x4,0)) vs N(X(x1,x2,x3,x4,1))
Select the assignment for x5 that is higher. (Still based on random probability of other variables).</p>

<p>N(X(x1,x2,x3,x4,0)) = N(x1 + x2) + N(x2+ ¬x4) + N(x2) + N(¬x2+ x4) + (1)</p>

<h3>Derandomised TSP</h3>

<p>There is a PTAS for Euclidean(TSP in Euclidean space) TSP.</p>

<p>Approximation algorithm with 3/2.</p>

<pre><code>1. Compute a MST.

2. Traverse the tree to find a tour that may  
visit nodes more than once.

3. Take other routes to avoid visiting
nodes more than once.

4. The resulting tour has length &lt;= 2 . MST

<h2>Amortized Analysis</h2>

<h3>Aggregate analysis.</h3>

<p>Compute a tight bound on the worst case of n operations.</p>

<h3>Credit Method</h3>

<p>Pay for some operations.
These prepay for other operations. <br />
Credit is stored on the system. <br />
Must be in credit at all times.  </p>

<p>Amortised cost = amount we charge.</p>

<h3>Potential Method</h3>

<p>Credit method - Stores credit with objects <br />
whereas <br />
The potential method stores credit with the structure as a whole.</p>

<p>Potential can be released to pay for later operations.</p>

<p>One unit of potential pays for any constant-time operation.</p>

<p>ɸ: Configurations --> R</p>

<p>ĉ = Amortized cost = real cost + change in potential <br />
Denoted with a c-hat. c with a circumflex.</p>

<p>Potential always need to be positive. Initial potential can be 0.</p>

<p>Table example:  </p>

<p>ɸ(T) = 2 * num[T] - size(T) <br />
      1/2*size(T) - num[T]</p>

<h2>Disjoint Sets – Union-Find Problem</h2>

<p>Operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Union</li>
<li>Make-set</li>
<li>Find</li>
</ul>

<p>A set of DISJOINT sets. (Obviously).</p>

<h3>MST implementation with Disjoint Forests - Disjoint Forests. I totally get you now.</h3>

<pre><code>For each edge (u,v) of G,
taken in increasing weight:
    if Find-set(u) =/= Find-set(v):
        A.add(u,v)
        Union(u,v)
Return A
</code></pre>

<h3>Array</h3>

<p>Elements in range 1..n - just use an array with n elements. <br />
Union is O(n) though.</p>

<h3>Linked List.</h3>

<pre><code>Node:
    Value
    *Next

    *Head
    *Tail
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Weighted Union:</strong> Store list length(can just store this in head/representative), append shorter list.</p>

<p>m+n operations takes O(m + n lg(n) )</p>

<h3>Forests - Disjoint set forests</h3>

<p>Each set is a tree <br />
Each elem points to its parent.</p>

<h3>Link By Size</h3>

<p>Subtree count for each node. <br />
Make set needs to increment this.</p>

<h3>Link by rank</h3>

<p>Maintain a <strong>rank</strong> for each node. Initially 0.
Link on node with smaller rank. <br />
If ranks are equal, pick arbitrarily and then increase rank.</p>

<pre><code>Nodes:
    Value
    Rank
    *Parent
</code></pre>

<p>Properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lemma</strong> Root of rank k has >= 2^k nodes in its tree.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lemma</strong> Highest rank of a node is &lt;= log n.</p></li>
<li><p>For any integer r there are n / 2^r nodes with that rank.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Path compression</h3>

<p>From searching for x, Find the root of tree. <br />
Move all nodes encountered along the way so that they are children of root.</p>

<pre><code>Find(x)
    if x.parent =/= x
        x.parent = Find(x.parent)
    return x.parent
</code></pre>

<h3>Log Star</h3>

<p>2 ↑ n+1 = 2^ (2↑n)
2↑0 = 1</p>

<p>lg* n = max{k | 2↑k &lt;= n }</p>

<p><a id="BSTs"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Binary Search Trees</h2>

<pre><code>@implementation BST
    Node Root
    - (void) insert:(int) x
    - (void) delete:(Node) x

    - (Node) search:(Int) x

    - (Node) min
    - (Node) max

    - (Node) succ:(int) x
    - (Node) pred:(int) x
</code></pre>

<p>BST property - strict inequality, so no duplicates, it stores a <em>set</em>.</p>

<p>Search - returns where the elemnt is <strong>OR</strong> should be.</p>

<p><a id="RedBlackTrees"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Red Black Trees</h2>

<p>Properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>Either red or Black.</li>
<li>Each red node has two black children.</li>
<li>Root is black</li>
<li>For all nodes n, there exists x, all paths from n to a leaf contain exactly x black nodes.</li>
<li>Leaves are nil and black.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Insert (x):</h3>

<p>Place x in the tree where it goes in the BST. <br />
Colour it <em>RED</em></p>

<p><strong>Case (<em>RED</em> uncle):</strong> <br />
Recolour parent, uncle, grandparent. <br />
Recursively fix grandparent  </p>

<p>{Following cases assume <strong><em>Black</em></strong> Uncle}  </p>

<p><strong>Case (zig-zag / zag-zig):</strong> <br />
Rotate node with parent.
(Rotate to zig-zig (or zag-zag)).</p>

<p><strong>Case (zig-zig / zag-zag):</strong> <br />
Right-Rotate grandparent. <br />
Recolour old grandparent and recolour new grandparent black. (just make sure the rules hold)</p>

<p>At the end, recolour the root black.</p>

<h3>Theories</h3>

<p>n items means height &lt;= 2 log(n+1).</p>

<p><a id="SplayTrees"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Splay Trees</h2>

<p>CAN BE UNBALANCED!!!</p>

<p>Amortised cost of O(log n).</p>

<p>Splay(x): <br />
Find x <br />
"Splay" x to root with rotations.</p>

<h3>Left Rotate</h3>

<p><img src="leftRotate.png" alt="To the left one time" title="" /></p>

<h3>Right Rotate</h3>

<p><img src="rightRotate.png" alt="Slide to the right" title="" /></p>

<p>Zig basically means left child.</p>

<p><strong>Zig-zig operation:</strong> <br />
{Left Child;Left Child} (from GP to child). <br />
Right-rotate grandparent. <br />
Right-rotate parent.  </p>

<p><strong>Zig-Zag:</strong> <br />
{Left Child;Right Child}. <br />
Left-rotate parent <br />
Right-rotate grandparent.  </p>

<p>There is also the simple case of just a zig... <br />
Too simple to be highlighted here 👊</p>

<p><strong>Rank(x)=</strong> Log(size(x)) <br />
With size(x) = Number of nodes in subtree of x. <br />
{Technically size is defined in terms of weight, but the notes just give
  all nodes a weight of 1.}</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>After search we find either the root or its succ or its pred. <br />
We move whatever we find to the root. <br />
return root.  </p>

<h3>Insert</h3>

<p>Insert is BST insert(x) and then splay (x).</p>

<h3>Delete</h3>

<p>A bit more interesting.  </p>

<p>Splay x to the root. <br />
Delete the root. <br />
Pick succ x or pred x. Splay it to the root of its subtree S1 <br />
Add the other subtree as a child of S1.</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

<p>Weight of each node is 1.</p>

<p>Size(x) = weight of its subtree.</p>

<p><strong>Tree Potential</strong> = Sum of ranks of tree nodes. {Yes, all nodes}  </p>

<p>ɸ(T) = <br />
⎲  r(x) <br />
⎳ <br />
x in T  </p>

<p>Rank(x) = log(size x)</p>

<p>Perfectly balanced tree has potential θ(n).</p>

<p><strong>Access Lemma:</strong> <br />
The amortized cost of splaying a node x is at most: <br />
1 + 3*( r'(x) - r(x) ) <br />
{r is rank before splaying. <br />
   r' is rank after splaying. }</p>

<p><strong>Balance Theorem</strong> <br />
In a tree with at most n items. The amortized cost of Search, Insert and Delete
is <em>O(log n)</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Colollary:</strong> In a tree with n items, m search/insert/delete operations costs
at most O(m logn + n logn).</p>

<p>Optimal Static Search Trees. <br />
Leaves frequently accessed stuff near the root.
Splay trees are within a constant of the optimal dynamic search tree. <br />
Splay trees are also within a constant of the optimal static search tree.  </p>

<p><a id="FFT"></a></p>

<hr />

<h2>Fast fourier transforms</h2>

<p>Degree bound n - means degree strictly less than x^n. (So x^ n-1).</p>

<p>Horner's rule - <strong>Evaluation in O(n)</strong> aritmethic operations <br />
A(x0) = a0 + x0(a1 + x0(a2 +... + x0(an-2 + x0*an-1) ... )).</p>

<p>Multiplication is O(n^2)</p>

<p>Aim is to multiply faster than θ(n^2).</p>

<h3>Point-value representation</h3>

<p>Represent as n pairs of values, (xi, yi) on the curve. The Vandermonde matrix is
non-singular when the x values are distinct therefore it uniquely determines a polynomial.</p>

<p>Addition and <strong>multiplication</strong> over the same basis takes <strong>O(n)</strong> arithmetic
operations.</p>

<p>Better way to do it in O(n Log(n)).</p>

<p>Interpolation is the conversion back into coefficient form.</p>

<h3>Converting coefficient to point-value form:</h3>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> O(n^2) using Horner's rule. <br />
Best done in point-value form, so we translate.
Just evaluate the coefficient form for x at x0, x1 ,..., xn.  </p>

<p><strong>Interpolation:</strong>
Use the Vandermonde matrix. Basically we know the point-values <br />
Vandermonde matrix has each line as a geometric progression <br />
detV(x0, x1,..., xn-1) = Product (xk-xj) all j &lt; k &lt; n.</p>

<p>So we solve Ax=b (for x, naturally). <br />
Gaussian elimination, do this in O(n^3) arithmetic.</p>

<p>Lagrange's formula to directly compute A(x) with only <strong>O(n^2)</strong>:</p>

<p>A(x) = <br />
n-1 <br />
⎲        Product x - xj  (j=/=k) <br />
⎳ yk *  ------------------------- <br />
           Product(xk-xj) (j=/=k) <br />
k=0</p>

<p>There are n nth-roots of unity. 👌</p>

<h3>DTF 🍆 - Discrete Fourier transforms</h3>

<p>Transformation from coefficient ==> point-value where we use roots of unity as
our xi values.</p>

<p>ω is one root of unity.</p>

<p>Define ω = ωn = exp(2πi/n) <br />
DFTn(A) = (A(1), A(ω), ..., A(ω^ n-1) )
So we're evaluating at the unity points. <br />
§
FFT is an Algorithm to compute the DFT.</p>

<h3>Divide and conquer:</h3>

<p>A(X) = B(x^2) + x.C(x^2)
B and C degree n/2 bound.</p>

<p>So to compute DFTn(A) we can just calculate DFTn/2(B) and DFTn/2(C).</p>

<p>Takes O(n log(n)) work.</p>

<p>Algorithm in pseduo code</p>

<pre><code>FFT(a[0.. n-1])
    If n=1
       then return a
    wn:= e^2pi*i/n
x := 1
    Array B := FFT(a[0, 2, ... , n-2])
Array C := FFT(a[1, 3, ... , n-1])

Array y
for(k=0; k&lt;n/2; k++)
   y[k]    := B[k] +x *C[k]
   y[k+n/2]:= B[k] -x *C[k]
   x := x* wn
return y
</code></pre>

<p>This is recursive and does evaluation in O(n log(n)).</p>

<h3>Evaluation equivalent to interpolation ???</h3>

<p>DFTn(a) = (Y0, ..., Yn-1)
Yk = A(wk) = Sum (j=0,n-1) aj w^kj</p>

<p>The DFT is <em>JUST</em> a matrix-vector product. <br />
Writing a and y = DFTn(a) as column vectors, we have: <br />
y=Va, V is the vandermonde matrix found by th DFT.  </p>

<p>a = y V^-1</p>

<p>V-prime is obtained by replacing each entry w^k with w^-k in V.</p>

<p>V<em>V-prime = n</em>I.</p>

<p>V is non-singular and V^-1 = 1/n * V-prime.</p>
